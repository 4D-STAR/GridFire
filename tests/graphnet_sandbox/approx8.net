# Reaction network definition for the approx8 network.
# This file lists the reactions to be included for a direct
# comparison with the hard-coded approx8 network.

# --- PP Chain ---
p(p,e+)d
d(p,g)he3
he3(he3,2p)he4

# --- CNO Cycle ---
# Note: approx8 simplifies the CNO cycle using branching fractions,
# but these are the primary gateway reactions.
